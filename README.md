# Structure

Main branch is `master`

The DOM is generated by files in the `frontend/src` directory.

```
|____frontend
| |____src
| | |____Frontend
| | | |____App.hs
| | | |____Router.hs
| | |____Main.hs
| | |____static
```

Static elements used on the front end are in the `static` folder. 

```
|____static
| |____font-awesome-4.7.0
| |____font.css
| |____fonts
| |____style.css
```

Elements used by the front and back ends are saved in the `common` directory.

```
