# Structure

You can look directly at HTML components in `src/html`, or build and run a server to see the live webpage.

Some DOM may be commented out with description explaining when it's used (eg modals, or mobile vs desktop).

# Building, working, watching, etc

```bash
# Install necessary NPM packages
npm install

# Builds the HTML and CSS
npm run build

# Runs a small server that will also reload pages when resources change
npm run serve

# Starts a server and watches all HTML/CSS and config files for changes
npm run work
```
