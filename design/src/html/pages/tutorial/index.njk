        <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl sm:text-2xl mb-4 mt-12">Literate Haskell</h3>
        <p class="body-copy">This document is a literate haskell source file written in markdown. We're using markdown-unlit to process this source file and turn it into something our compiler can understand.</p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl sm:text-2xl mb-4 mt-12">Running the code</h3>
        <p class="body-copy">Get started with Reflex Platform, the most flexible way to build a Reflex frontend for your application.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">Build user interfaces for applications on desktop, mobile, terminal, or the web with a curated set of packages and tools that have been tested across all platforms.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">With support for multiple platforms, management of cross-platform dependencies, and interoperability with existing apps, Reflex Platform is the best choice for writing a new front end or finishing off a back end.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">Get started quickly with Reflex Platform here.</p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl sm:text-2xl mb-4 mt-12">Convert Parts of an Existing App to Reflex</h3>
        <p class="body-copy">Start using Reflex like you would any other Haskell library to convert portions of an existing application.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">Download the Reflex library from Hackage and begin building interactive components in pure functional style with Cabal or Stack. This allows you to incrementally introduce FRP concepts into your codebase, and create Reflex widgets that integrate with existing Haskell code.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">You can also download and use the Reflex VTY and Reflex DOM packages independently. Enjoy complete flexibility coupled with the full power of FRP. Integrate Reflex into your applications however you see fit.</p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl sm:text-2xl mb-4 mt-12">Take FRP for a Test Drive</h3>
        <p class="body-copy">Use Reflex Platform to run Try Reflex if you're looking to get a casual and quick start, but not commit to an entire project.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">This is an easy way to become familiar with FRP concepts without worrying about servers or an application. Fast, simple, get started here with Reflex Platform.</p>

        <h2 class="font-semibold text-3xl sm:text-4xl mb-4 mt-20">Learn Reflex-FRP</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-500 md:text-lg mb-4">A functional understanding of Haskell is all that’s needed to begin learning Reflex-FRP. If you’d like more information on coding in Haskell, scroll down to ‘Haskell for Beginners’.</p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl sm:text-2xl mb-4 mt-12">Reflex-FRP Basics</h3>
        <p class="body-copy">If FRP is a new paradigm for you, give yourself the time to learn its declarative style. Below are some great resources on the basics of Reflex. Use these to kickstart your learning, or just familiarise yourself with Reflex terminology before beginning our tutorial.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Read through this written Reflex quick guide.</li>
          <li>Watch this video on the basics of FRP.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl sm:text-2xl mb-4 mt-12">Reflex Extended Education</h3>
        <p class="body-copy">Check out this educational introduction to Reflex. The project consists of two talks and a 13-part guide on the basics of Reflex and the use cases where it makes the most significant impact.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">If you’re more interested in writing a GUI in Haskell, read this beginner-friendly step by step tutorial for Reflex DOM. It explains in detail how to write GUI programs that run in a web browser or as a desktop application, in a functional way.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">If you’d prefer a more advanced take on using Reflex DOM to build front-end web applications, check out this fantastic one. It has a higher-level feel, intending to get you up to speed on building apps quickly.</p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl sm:text-2xl mb-4 mt-12">Haskell for Beginners</h3>
        <p class="body-copy">If you’re not yet familiar with Haskell, this series of online lessons from the University of Pennsylvania is approachable, is informative, and walks you through the basics of the language. With reading recommendations and ‘homework’ problems, this is an academic approach to learning Haskell.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">Similarly, this 12-part series is a gentle introduction to Haskell aimed at those with an imperative background. No previous experience with functional programming or advanced mathematics is required. Sort through the well-named chapters if you’d like to brush up on a specific element of Haskell, or read all the way through for a comprehensive education.</p>

        <h3 class="font-semibold text-xl sm:text-2xl mb-4 mt-12">The Tutorial</h3>
        <p class="body-copy">If you feel comfortable with your Haskell abilities and have done all the ‘reading up’ on FRP you care to, get started on our Reflex tutorial! The tutorial walks you through building a simple functional reactive calculator that can be used in a web browser, beginning with the download instructions for Nix and Obelisk.</p>
        <p class="body-copy">Even if you don’t plan to build a calculator for your own project, this tutorial is helpful as it teaches the fundamentals of building a Reflex application, and the key concepts at play. A familiarity with this process will make developing other applications much easier. If you get stuck, try referencing our resources page, or #reflex-frp on IRC.</p>
